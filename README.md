## :scroll: Description
My Timer can be changed an input field, which visibility is animated. The field checks if the value for the
seconds is a valid number, updated by a state. The Timer can be started and the clock is flipped by an animation and the time
value is also visualized by the changing background size


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
I like the animation of the rotation of the clock and that everything is so smooth. The Countdowntimer is in the ViewModel
and the values are updated via livedata
